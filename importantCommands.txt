Compile a C++ program on Mac use:
    - clang++ bikeracemain.cpp -o bikeracemain //This for the c++98 version
    - clang++ -std=c++17 bikeracemain.cpp -o bikeracemain

On C, use the command:
    - clang -g -o program_name program_name.c

Using CMake and how to compile with it
    1. To compile the project and it's file use this series of command.
        - mkdir build    NOTE: If you already have a build directory don't make one. If you then do make one.
        - cd build 
        - cmake ..
        - make 
    
    2. If you need to recompile the project because you make changes
       or added new files, then you are going to add the new files on the 
       CMakeList.txt file, and then recomplie the project cleanly.

       !Make sure you add the files on you CMakeList.txt. 
       I already made the mistake on not adding them and it took me a while
       to fix it.

       Here's how you do the recompile:
        = cd build
        - rm -rf *
        - cmake ..
        - make
